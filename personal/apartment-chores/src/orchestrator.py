"""Scheduler entry point. With src/report.py, one of the two modules that read
a clock, an environment, or argv.

Everything below it is pure or is a thin client. This file is the wiring: it
loads the term from config, reads Airtable, builds the schedule, and decides
what to write and what to send today.

Two jobs, either or both:

  --generate  write this week's assignments, and on a Monday send the digest
  --nudge     email whoever is past due, at most twice per assignment

With neither flag it does both, so the cron job is a bare invocation.

All date arithmetic happens in the policy timezone. The clock is read once,
at the top of the run, and passed down, so a run that straddles midnight or a
daylight saving boundary cannot disagree with itself halfway through.

No chore, person, room, or date appears here. The term comes from
config/calendar.py; everything else comes from Airtable.
