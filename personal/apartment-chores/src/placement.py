"""Placement for chores that follow the cleaner instead of a fixed interval.

Pure functions. No file reads, no network, no clock. See
PRD-v1.2-after-cleaner.md for the rule this implements.

A placed chore gets one turn per person per term. The rotation engine can say
where a fixed-interval chore lands in any week of the term from its offset
alone. A placed chore's weeks depend on when the cleaner actually comes, and
on what has already been written, so this module takes both as inputs:

  written_weeks  the week numbers already in Assignments. Their rows are
                 history and are returned exactly as written, never
                 re-decided, so a visit confirmed or moved later cannot
                 change a week that has started.
  history        (week_number, chore_key, person) for every written row.

Every week not yet written is projected from today's confirmed visits. Only
the current week's projection is ever written, on its Monday, and a week that
exists is never regenerated, so the projection for later weeks is free to
change as visits are confirmed.

A turn lands in week W when any of these holds:

  target      W is the active week containing a confirmed visit plus the
              delay, rolled forward past inactive weeks, and no other
              confirmed visit falls in W.
  cap         the last clean, a roommate turn or a confirmed visit, was
              cap_active_weeks or more active weeks before W. A confirmed
              visit in W itself is that week's clean, so it cancels the
              forced turn.
  end of term the people still owed a turn are at least as many as the
              active weeks left, counting W.

Turns go in rotation order from the chore's seed, skipping anyone who has
already had one. No chore, person, or room name appears here.
