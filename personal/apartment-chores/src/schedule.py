"""Schedule builder.

Turns the rotation engine's bare assignments into the things that actually get
written and emailed: what the task says, when it is due, and whether a
confirmed cleaner visit turned it into prep.

Pure functions. No file reads, no network, no clock. The current date is not
an input here; this module says what a term's schedule is, not what is due
today. Everything it needs about a chore beyond the rotation arrives in a
details mapping supplied by the caller, so no chore, room, or person name
appears in this file.
