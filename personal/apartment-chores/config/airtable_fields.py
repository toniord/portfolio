"""Airtable table and field name configuration.

Every string here is the exact name of a table or field in the Airtable base.
Build the base to match these names. To rename something in Airtable, change
the string here and nowhere else.

Table and field types are noted in comments. Single-select values that must
match the code's registry keys are called out explicitly.
