"""Two-way sync between SQLite and the Airtable base. Milestone 5.

SQLite is the source of truth. Airtable is where the owner reads and labels, and
those labels come back here. PRD section 6.

Direction matters and the order is deliberate:

  1. Reconcile. Read every Airtable posting row once and match it to a posting
     by its Hash field, repairing any stored record id that went stale because a
     row was deleted by hand.
  2. Pull. Read the owner's five editable fields into SQLite. This runs first so a
     label written since the last sync is never lost.
  3. Prune. Delete rows for postings that are closed and already labelled. They
     are resolved, SQLite still has them, and the free plan caps a base at
     roughly a thousand records.
  4. Push. Refresh the agent-written fields on rows that exist, then create rows
     for the newest surfaced postings up to the cap.

The push never writes an editable field. The owner's edits are inputs, and an
agent that overwrites its own input surface destroys the only training signal
the ranker has.

Which Airtable field carries which SQLite column is `sources/airtable.toml`.
Nothing in this module names a field.

    Returned as a SQL fragment so the prune can use it as an OR and the push as
    a NOT of the same string. CLAUDE.md rule 9 says every prune must be paired
    with a push exclusion or the row is deleted and recreated on every run
    forever; building one string and negating it makes that pairing structural,
    where two hand-written clauses are two things that can drift apart. The
    sixth prune rule had them written out twice for about an hour and that was
    already one copy too many.

    Two reasons a posting is demoted, and one set of exemptions.

    TIER. A band `rubric.md` marks delivery "never". Nothing will ever email it,
    so it should not hold one of 600 slots either.

    AGE. Added 2026-09-20 because this was the real complaint. Rows only ever
    left the base when they resolved, so a posting that stayed open and
    unlabelled held its slot indefinitely. Measured that day: 335 of 600 slots
    were held by postings 30 or more days old while 1,040 postings from the
    previous month could not get in. The base was not a view of the search, it
    was a photograph of early August.

    Age is the only safe basis for an eviction here, and that is the whole
    reason it is age rather than score. A posting only gets older, so eviction
    is one-way: nothing evicted for age can become young again and be recreated
    next run. An eviction on rank would oscillate every time a score moved,
    which is the churn rule 9 is written about and would burn the monthly quota
    while stranding record ids. Do not replace this with a score.

    EXEMPTIONS, which are the same principle as the prefilter's label override.
    A role he marked interested stays whatever its age or tier, because his yes
    outranks anything computed. A role he applied to stays, because the pipeline
    is the one thing the base must never lose. And the tiers in
    `age_exempt_tiers` stay however old they are, because a tier 1 role open for
    two months is still the best thing on the page.

        #    the second was added 2026-08-12 and the third on 2026-08-15.
        #
        #    Killed: the base is meant to mirror what the filter surfaces, and
        #    tightening a rule has to be able to take a posting back out. Before
        #    this, editing sources/prefilter.toml removed a posting from the
        #    digest and from scoring but left it sitting in Airtable forever,
        #    because prune only ever looked at closed rows. The owner tightened
        #    four rules that day and 125 rows were stranded, including the exact
        #    "Law School Student Ambassador" posting that prompted the change.
        #
        #    Closed and not being pursued: the door is shut and he either said no
        #    or never looked. Nothing is lost, since SQLite keeps every field.
        #
        #    Judged and finished with: still open, marked not interested, and a
        #    reason written. The reason is the condition on purpose. A pruned row
        #    can never be edited again, so this only takes the ones he actually
        #    completed and leaves a blank-reason row sitting in front of him
        #    until he writes the sentence. On 2026-08-15 that split 9 and 3.
        #
        #    Deliberately NOT pruned: a closed posting he marked interested.
        #    Those used to go, which is how a role he was applying to vanished
        #    from the base without anything saying so. Several had disappeared
        #    that way. They cost a handful of records and they are
        #    the ones he most wants to still be able to see.
        #
        #    Hidden by the location collapse: one of several cities of a role
        #    that another row already stands for. Added 2026-08-16. This is the
        #    fourth prune rule and the only one whose paired push exclusion is
        #    not automatic, so the two are computed together below rather than in
        #    two places that could drift. CLAUDE.md rule 9.
        #
        #    Closed by the owner: he ticked Closed because he learned the role was
        #    gone before the watcher did. Added 2026-08-19, and it is the fifth
        #    rule whose push exclusion is not automatic, so the query below
        #    carries the matching clause. Without the pair the row is deleted
        #    here and recreated by the push on the same run, forever, which is
        #    the failure rule 9 is written about.
        #
        #    Unlike every other prune rule this one is reversible from his side.
        #    Unticking the box restores the row on the next run, because the
        #    prune is a consequence of the column rather than a decision of its
        #    own. That only works while nothing else reads the deletion as
        #    meaning anything, which is why his tick writes closed_by_me and
        #    never closed_detected_at.
        #    Sixth rule, added 2026-09-20: a tier the rubric will never deliver.
        #
        #    The tiers come from `rubric.md`, from the bands whose delivery is
        #    "never", rather than from a number written here. That keeps one
        #    definition of what a tier means, per CLAUDE.md rule 3: if the owner
        #    moves tier 4 back onto the Sunday roundup, its rows return without
        #    a code change. Today that is tier 4 alone, 43 rows of the 600.
        #
        #    Two exemptions, and both are the same principle as the prefilter's
        #    label override. A role he marked interested stays whatever the
        #    model scored it, because his yes beats the ranker's no. A role he
        #    applied to stays, because the pipeline is the one thing the base
        #    must never lose.
        #
        #    Like the closed_by_me rule above, this one's push exclusion is NOT
        #    automatic, so the candidate query below carries the matching
        #    clause. The residual churn is a re-score moving a posting out of
        #    the band, which recreates the row; scoring happens once per posting
        #    so that is rare, and a retitle already resets the score anyway.
