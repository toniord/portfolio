"""Referral contacts. PRD section 7.

People live in `sources/contacts.toml`, never here. This module loads that file

the owner know anyone at this company.

The load is idempotent, keyed on name plus company, so it runs on every watcher
run and editing the TOML is all that is needed to add someone.
