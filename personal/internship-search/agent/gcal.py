"""Google Calendar sync for application windows and posting deadlines.

Writes to a dedicated calendar, never to your primary one, so everything this
creates can be hidden or deleted in one action without touching your own events.

Every event carries a stable key in its private extended properties. The sync
looks an event up by that key and patches it, so running this repeatedly updates
events in place instead of piling up duplicates. Changing a key in the TOML after
its event exists is the one thing that breaks that guarantee.

Auth is a one-time OAuth consent in the browser. The resulting token is cached in
.google-token.json and refreshes itself; neither it nor credentials.json is
committed. See README for the Google Cloud setup.

    would be a required dependency for an optional step.
