"""Collapse one role posted across many cities into one item.

Requested 2026-08-12. This is a presentation layer and nothing else. Every city
keeps its own row in SQLite, its own requisition id, its own miss counter and its
own closure date, because a board that issues one id per city is issuing
genuinely separate postings. Merging them at the identity layer would reintroduce
exactly the defect CLAUDE.md rule 6 exists to prevent: an edit to one city's
listing would move the merged key, close the whole role, and rediscover it as new
with every label and override left behind.

So the rule is: group late, never store the grouping. Two callers group, the
digest and the Airtable push, and both hand a list of stored rows in and get a
list of groups out. Nothing here writes anything.

No company name, job title or city appears in this module. The grouping key is
the company name run through the same normalizer the aggregator feeds use, plus
the title reduced to its letters and digits. A city list would be data, not code,
and is not needed: the locations come off the rows themselves.

    another on the next sync, every time the ranker touched the group. Row ids
    only ever increase, so the oldest member is a lead that never moves while
    the group's membership holds. CLAUDE.md rule 9's churn trap.

    A label overrides age, and that is not a hole in the stability argument. The
    hidden rows are not in the base, so they cannot acquire a new label; the only
    ones that carry one are historical, from before the collapse existed. Without
    this the group would show a blank Label for a role he had already said yes
    to, which reads as the base having lost his answer. One such row existed: a
    listing he marked interested in a city that was not the oldest.

    An application overrides age for the same reason. When he applied to one
    city's listing of a role, the collapse led with an older row in another
    city, so the base showed that role as not applied and his Applied view
    could not find it. What he did to a posting outranks which city
    happened to be discovered first.

    Applied beats labelled beats age. Both exceptions are stable in practice
    because both are his own actions on a row already in the base, so neither
    flips back and forth on its own.
