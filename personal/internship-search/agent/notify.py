def send(subject: str, body: str) -> bool:
    """Returns True if the email actually went out. Never raises.

    Every caller is written against that sentence. `agent/run.py` stamps a
    posting as alerted only `if sent`, which is CLAUDE.md rule 10, and
    `tools/scheduled_run.py` stamps a health alert on the same test. A caller
    that has to guard the call as well as the answer gets the rule wrong
    eventually.

    Until 2026-09-07 the sentence was only half true. An unconfigured mailbox
    returned False; every transport error raised, and the exception went all the
    way out of `agent/run.py:main`. So a laptop with no network turned into a
    failed run: six days in the fortnight to 2026-09-07 ended that way, each one
    recorded as a failure of the watcher, which had in fact polled 176 boards
    and stored everything it found. Because the watcher is the required step,
    the run also stopped before the Airtable and calendar syncs, and Airtable
    only syncs on the digest job, so the base went unmirrored on exactly the
    days the mail was down.

    Nothing was lost from the digest itself, because a send that did not happen
    stamps nothing and the postings are offered again on the next run. What was
    lost was the ability to tell a mail outage from a broken watcher by reading
    the log.

    Returning False does not make the failure quiet. The caller reports it in
    the run report, and `tools/scheduled_run.py` turns that into a health fault
    of its own, so an agent that cannot reach its mail server is still a fault
    the owner hears about. It is just no longer a fault attributed to the wrong
    part of the system.
