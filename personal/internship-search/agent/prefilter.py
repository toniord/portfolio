"""Stage A, the deterministic prefilter. PRD.md section 5, no LLM anywhere.

Every posting the watchers store passes through here and comes out with one of
three verdicts.

    killed    excluded by a hard rule. Never scored, never emailed.
    surface   goes on to the ranker, carrying any flags it picked up.
    pending   cannot be decided yet because the timing rules need the term, and
              Stage 0 has not tagged this posting. It waits for the next run.

The split into two passes is the whole design. `evaluate_hard` applies the
exclusions that need no term at all: is this even a student role, is it a quant
trading title, is it confidently outside the United States, does it demand a
clearance he does not have, is it graduate-only. `evaluate_timing` applies the
term and hours rules and runs only on what survived. Postings die in the first
pass without ever costing a model call, which is what keeps Stage 0 inside the
ten dollar budget in PRD section 2.

No company, city, job title, or term name appears in this file. All of it lives
in sources/prefilter.toml. If the filter is wrong, that file is where to fix it.

The asymmetry stated in PRD section 5 runs through every decision here. A false
kill is invisible, because the owner never sees what was dropped. A false surface
costs him three seconds. So anything this module cannot resolve confidently is
surfaced with a flag, never dropped.
