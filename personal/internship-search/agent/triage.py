"""Runs Stage A and Stage 0 over the open postings. PRD.md sections 4 and 5.

This is the orchestration only; the rules are in agent/prefilter.py, the model
call is in agent/tagger.py, and the writes are in agent/db.py. Three passes,
in this order, and the order is the cost control.

    1. Hard exclusions. Every posting the prefilter has not seen. No term
       needed, no model call, most of the volume dies here.
    1.5 Descriptions, for postings that arrived without one. One HTTP request
       per surviving posting, then the hard rules run again now that there is
       text for them to read. Workday company boards, and since 2026-10-03
       feed postings whose link points at a Greenhouse, Lever, Ashby or
       Workday board.
    2. Stage 0 tagging. Only survivors of pass 1, and only the ones whose
       aggregator feed did not already state the term.
    3. Timing rules. Only survivors of pass 1 that pass 2 has answered for.

Every pass is resumable. A posting the model-call budget could not reach stays
pending and is picked up on the next run, so a capped run loses nothing.
