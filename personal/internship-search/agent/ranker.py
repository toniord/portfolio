"""Stage B and Stage C, the ranker. PRD.md section 4, Milestone 6.

Scores every posting the prefilter surfaced on two axes, fit and reach, and
derives a tier from the result. Two stages, because the two questions cost very
different amounts to answer well.

    Stage B  the cheap model, on every survivor. Most postings are decided here.
    Stage C  the expensive model, only on what clears the routing thresholds in
             rubric.md. Its answer replaces Stage B's on the same row.

Nothing in this file knows what a good posting looks like. Every criterion, both
anchors, the tier bands, the routing thresholds and the score range come out of
rubric.md at runtime, which is CLAUDE.md rule 3 and the reason the owner can change
how ranking behaves by editing prose. agent/rubric.py owns reading that file;
this module owns the model call and what is done with the answer.

Three things are worth knowing before changing anything here.

The prompt is the rubric plus the owner's own labelled examples, in that order, and
it is identical across every call in a run. That is what makes it worth caching.
Whether caching actually happens depends on length: Anthropic ignores a cache
request on a prefix below the model's minimum, which is 4,096 tokens on Haiku and
1,024 on Sonnet. The rubric alone is about 2,300, so Stage C caches from the
second call onward and Stage B does not cache at all until enough labelled
examples are attached to carry it over the line. `run` reports which is happening
rather than leaving it to be guessed at.

Output is structured JSON enforced by the API, and the valid score range is built
into the schema as an enum out of rubric.md. A model cannot return a 12 on a 1 to
10 scale, so no clamping code is needed and none exists.

The owner's score overrides beat the model. The model's number is still stored, so
a disagreement stays visible, but the tier is derived from the override where he
wrote one.

    cached tokens in `cache_read_input_tokens` and `cache_creation_input_tokens`
