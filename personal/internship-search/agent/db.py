    It starts life as the posting's content hash, which is what makes a stored

    because the two answer different questions and drift apart the moment a
    company edits a listing: the content hash follows the edit and the row key,
    correctly, does not.

    That drift is what killed every run between 2026-08-17 and 2026-08-18. An
    Anthropic requisition stored on 2026-08-13 under `SF | NYC` kept the key it
    was given while the company added Seattle and moved its content hash on. A
    genuinely different requisition then arrived still carrying `SF | NYC`,
    computed the same key, matched no stored row by identity or by content
    because it really was a different posting, and hit the unique index on
    insert. The watcher is a required step, so all four runs stopped there.

    So: take the content hash when the table does not already hold it, which is
    the overwhelming majority of inserts, and otherwise derive a key from the
    identity, which is one per requisition by construction. The counter covers
    the case where even that is taken, which needs two boards to collide on a
    derived digest and has never happened.

    This is a storage rule, not an identity rule. It decides what a new row is
