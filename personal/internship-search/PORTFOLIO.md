Tracks internship postings across 180 company job boards (Greenhouse, Lever, Ashby, Workday) and
three aggregator feeds, four times a day. As of October 2026 it has tracked 40,659 postings. A
rules filter defined as data cuts the 27,968 open ones to 2,485 (8.9%). Claude Haiku 4.5 reads
the term and weekly hours once from each new posting that passes the first rules and that no
feed has already labelled. Feeds carry only a link, so the agent reads each link's shape to find
the Greenhouse, Lever, Ashby, Workday, Oracle or SmartRecruiters job behind it and fetches the
description before ranking. A two-stage ranker then scores survivors against a fixed-anchor
rubric. Haiku scores every posting, and only those above a routing threshold go to Claude Sonnet
5. Each prompt carries all 53 of my Airtable labels as few-shot examples, which also pushed the
prompt past Haiku's caching threshold, so every call after the first in a run reads it at a
tenth of the input price. A hard per-run call cap bounds spending. Output goes to a daily email,
an Airtable base and a local dashboard, on a launchd schedule with health alerts. About 11,000
lines of Python including tests, and 533 checks.
