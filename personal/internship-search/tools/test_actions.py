"""The action block, the applied date, and the owner's own closure. 2026-08-19.

    .venv/bin/python -m tools.test_actions

Spends nothing, sends nothing, and never touches state.db.

Three features are tested together because they are one loop: he opens the
Interested view, flips Applied status or ticks Closed, and the digest stops
asking him about it. Each of the three has a way of failing that leaves no trace
anywhere, which is why they are tested rather than looked at.

    the action block   repeats forever by design, so a bug that stamps it would
                       silently empty his to-do list one item at a time
    applied_at         written once, on a transition the sync sees and nothing
                       records afterwards. Miss it and it is unrecoverable
    closed_by_me       prunes an Airtable row. Prune without the matching push
                       exclusion and the row is deleted and recreated forever,
                       which is CLAUDE.md rule 9

Run this after editing agent/delivery.action_content, agent/db.action_items,
the [actions] block in sources/email.toml, or the pull step of
