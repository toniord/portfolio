"""Clear stored scores so the ranker judges those postings again.

    .venv/bin/python -m tools.rescore --all --dry-run       # what it would cost
    .venv/bin/python -m tools.rescore --tier 3 --tier 4     # just the low bands
    .venv/bin/python -m tools.rescore --company acme
    .venv/bin/python -m tools.rescore --since 2026-09-01    # scored before a date
    .venv/bin/python -m tools.rescore --no-description      # scored with no posting text

WHY THIS EXISTS.

The ranker reads `db.unscored`, which selects on `fit_score IS NULL`, so a
posting is scored exactly once in its life. That is right for cost and wrong for
learning: the owner's labels are injected into every ranking prompt as examples, so
a new label changes how FUTURE postings are judged and never revises a score
already stored. Asked on 2026-09-25 whether the agent improves over time, the
honest answer was "yes, and only forward". This is the tool that makes it also
work backward, on demand.

DELIBERATELY NOT AUTOMATIC. Re-scoring on every label change would spend money
every time he touches a dropdown, and one new example among fifty rarely moves a
tier. Worth running after labelling a batch, not after labelling a row.

WHAT IT NEVER TOUCHES. `fit_override` and `reach_override` are the owner's own
numbers and outrank the model's by design, so they are left alone; a re-score
that wiped them would silently discard the strongest signal in the database. It
also leaves `label`, `applied_status`, `alerted_at` and the urgent stamps
untouched: a posting already emailed must not be emailed again just because it
was re-judged, which is CLAUDE.md rule 10.
