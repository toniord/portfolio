"""Cases the prefilter must get right. Run with:

    .venv/bin/python -m tools.test_prefilter

No test framework, no dependencies, no database. Each case is a posting and the
verdict it must produce, and the file prints what failed.

This exists because a prefilter bug is silent. A ranking mistake shows up in the
digest as a bad suggestion; a prefilter mistake shows up as nothing at all, and
the owner never learns what he did not see. Every case below is either a rule from
PRD section 5 or a real collision found in the live data on 2026-08-07.

Add a case here whenever you change sources/prefilter.toml, especially when
loosening a rule. The cases are cheap and the failure mode they guard is not.
