"""Sync SQLite and Airtable in both directions. Milestone 5.

    python -m tools.sync_airtable --dry-run   # show what would move, write nothing
    python -m tools.sync_airtable             # do it

Reads the owner's labels out of Airtable into SQLite, drops rows he has finished
with, and pushes the newest surfaced postings up to the record cap in
`sources/airtable.toml`.

Safe to run as often as you like. Rows are matched by their Hash field, so
repeat runs update in place rather than duplicating, and a row deleted by hand
in Airtable is noticed and re-created rather than silently lost.
