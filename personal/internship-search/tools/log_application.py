WHY THIS EXISTS RATHER THAN AN UPDATE STATEMENT.

`applied_status` is one of the owner's five editable fields, and step 2 of the
sync reads Airtable as authoritative for all five. So for any posting that
already has an `airtable_record_id`, writing SQLite alone is undone within six
hours: the pull reads the blank Airtable cell, maps it through `empty_value` to
`not_applied`, and overwrites what was just written. The push cannot save it
either, because an update deliberately never carries an editable field
(CLAUDE.md rule 9).

So this writes BOTH, and the Airtable half is the one that makes it stick. A
posting with no Airtable row needs only the SQLite write, because
`_create_payload` carries editable fields upward when the row is eventually
created, which is the same rule 9 asymmetry working in the other direction.

Cost, per CLAUDE.md rule 8: one call per ten records, and this writes only the
postings named on the command line. Logging every application of a whole cycle
is a handful of calls.
